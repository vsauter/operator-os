    name: Important Deals Analysis
    prompt: |
      Analyze the HubSpot deals and Gong call activity to identify the most important deals from the last week.

      For each important deal, provide:
      1. **Deal Name** and amount
      2. **Owner** (AE and SE if assigned)
      3. **Stage** and close date
      4. **Recent Activity** - calls from Gong in the last 7 days
      5. **Risk Level** - based on activity and close date proximity
      6. **Recommended Action** - what should happen next

      Prioritize deals by:
      - Deals with close dates in the next 30 days
      - Large deal amounts
      - Deals with recent call activity (good momentum)
      - Deals WITHOUT recent calls that need attention

      Format as a clear, actionable summary for a sales leader.

      Cross-reference HubSpot deals with Gong call activity to find coverage gaps.

      2. **High-value deals needing attention** - large deals with low engagement
      3. **Deals closing soon without recent contact** - urgent gaps

      For each gap, recommend specific actions.

      3. **Top Movers** - deals with most engagement this week
      4. **At Risk** - deals losing momentum
      5. **Wins/Losses** - any deals closed this week
